# Home Loan Application Prediction

## Problem
Manual assessment of home loan applications has led to long processing times and uncertainty with stakeholders. By using machine learning and predictive models, lenders can assess the risks associated with each application and streamline the loan approval process.

## Overview
This project aims to build a predictive model that categorizes loan applicants as either approved or denied based on their credit profile. The dataset consists of 614 instances of home loan applications, containing information about the applicantâ€™s profile such as gender, marital status, credit history, and more.

This project will:
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Train machine learning models
- Evaluate the performance of the models

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be downloaded through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/burak3ergun/loan-data-set/data)

## Requirements
- The 'loan.csv' dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/burak3ergun/loan-data-set/data)
- The dependancies listed in 'requirements.txt'

## Installation Instructions
